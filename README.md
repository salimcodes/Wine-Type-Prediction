# Wine-Type-Prediction
This Machine Learning Model predicts the type of a given wine –Type 1, Type 2, Type 3 based on the following features
1.	Alcohol content
2.	Malic Acid content
3.	Ash
4.	Alkalinity of ash
5.	Magnesium percentage content
6.	Total Phenols
7.	Flavonoids
8.	Non-Flavonoids phenols
9.	Proanthocyanins
10.	Color intensity
11.	Hue
12.	OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
13.	Quantity of Proline

>The model was built using the Gaussian Naïve – Bayes classifier with 25% of the dataset dedicated to test samples and 75% used for training the model.

On the training the model, it was seen to have a 93.33% Accuracy.
